# AlgorithmVisualizer

A sorting algorithm visualizer.. 

On going project that allows you too step through and see how these sorting algorithms work

You can see the strain on your computer with the OS statistics on the main window..

You can begin with editing the fields in the config file!

> Let's see how fast your computer is :)

Have Fun!!

Still trying to figure out how to export this into a standalone program. (So you don't need to download processing..)

## config

```processing
  barsSize: int, // pixel width of the bars
  algorithm: int // 1 = bubbleSort, 2 = selectionSort, 3 = insertionSort, 4 = mergeSort, 5 = quickSort
```
